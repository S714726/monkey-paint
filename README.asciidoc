Monkey Paint
------------
It has been said that a large collection of monkeys, paired with
typewriters and given enough time, could recreate the works of
Shakespeare. Now, imagine that these monkeys had the help of a demon,
one already familiar with Shakespeare, that held their hands back and
prevented them from hitting the typewriter keys whenever they were
about to make any particularly poor choices of letters or words. The
monkeys would surely be on their way to writing more accurate iambs,
and perhaps their work would converge to Shakespeare sooner than it
would by randomly jamming on the keys. But before converging, before
accurately reproducing Shakespeare, there would be something in the
middle--part Shakespeare, feces, banana peel, or random
gibberish--that would be a mix of Shakespeare and the monkey. Because
we already have the final product courtesy of Mr. Shakespeare himself,
we're more interested in examining the intermediate.

Replace written works with paintings and Shakespeare with your artist
of choice, and you have the premise of this program. Like apprentice
painters of yore, the monkey painter has a unique brush style of its
own, and will try to recreate the masterpiece you put in front of
it. But only with the help of the demon will it come close; even then,
the not-so-subtle differences between its brush strokes and the
original image will give its painting a different character. Not to
mention what will appear to be a widespread blur effect.

The program uses a simulated annealing algorithm as a manifestation of
the demon, but because of the nature of the problem, the results look
more like hill-climbing--outside of the initial splattering of the
canvas.

Installation
------------
Download the standalone jar and run directly, or

. Download http://www.processing.org[Processing] and copy or link its
   +lib/core.jar+ to the project's +lib/+ directory
. Install http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/[sbt] and
  build/run the project with +sbt run+ from the project directory

Usage
-----
. Select an image to reproduce by clicking the "Open" button in the
  upper-left
. Select a brush style from the tabs below
. Click the start button on the right to begin whipping the monkeys
  who in turn begin painting

The program has a lot of options that can be adjusted to
taste. "Reasonable" defaults are typically substituted for fields left
empty.

Additionally, depending on the image size, the JVM may require a bit
more RAM than it typically allocates (i.e. running the program with an
argument resembling +-Xmx2g+). Setting this preference through +sbt+
is a bit more involved.

Features for the far future
---------------------------
. More brush stroke and color options
. Implementation of some brush strokes with vector graphics
. Tweak the annealing threshold parameter based on the initial image
  and brush
